Implement concatenative synthesis synth in SuperCollider, bottom-up.

Play back arbitrary segments from a sample buffer at arbitrary rates.

The implementation uses BufRd, and ar envelope for defining the linear curve driving the Phaser.  The envelope is sent via OSC.  The ar envelope takes the place of Phasor.
